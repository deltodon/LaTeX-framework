\section{Citation examples}
\subsection{Sub1}



The following examples show how to produce Harvard style referencing using biblatex.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A citation command in parentheses: \parencite{Smith:2012qr}.
\item A citation command for use in the flow of text: As \textcite{Smith:2013jd} said \dots
\item A citation command which automatically switches style depending on location and the option setting in the package declaration (see line 12 in the LaTeX source code). In this case, it produces a citation in parentheses: \autocite{Other:2014ab}.
\end{enumerate}
